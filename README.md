##Super Special Syntax  

First off, I picked this name for my demo blog mostly because it popped into my head one night after a long day of coding.  It doesn't reflect anything but an appreciation of silliness.  That said, it _is_ meant to showcase my React code, and I am cautiously proud of it.  

Currently, this blog has only lorem ipsum content, but I intend to modify it in the future to contain links and screenshots to my projects and to serve as a portfolio.  

It is built with vanilla React and pulls content from a JSON file that is held in the top level state, then distributed to the child components as props.  

The user can select "posts" by month or keyword, and the filtered titles are then clickable to read the full post.  I also prefer cat ipsum to hipster ipsum, but I also feel you need to mix it up.  

Any feedback on my code is always welcome!

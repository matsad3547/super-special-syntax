This is my blog page and it is built with Reactjs.  Right now, it is pretty rudimentary.  Ideally, it will improve.

Here is the current plan of attack - clearly, its is going to be a work in progress:
* Pull blog content and data from a JSON object.
* Onpage load will display the absolute most recent blog post
* Allow the user to select blog posts by keyword (display most recent posts first)
* Allow the user to select blog posts by month (display an ordered list of blog posts by month - most recent first).
* Display lists of posts matching either month or keyword selections as a list of elements with both title, date, and the first sentence of the post.
* Figure out a way to enter new posts.
* Make the page look super sweet.
* Actually use it.
